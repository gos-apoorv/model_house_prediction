# ML Model Pipeline

## Housing Price Prediction
An end to end pipeline to demonstrate housing price model in California

## Steps

1. Step 1: Data Preprocessing
2. Step 2: Model Training
3. Step 3: Model Evaluation
4. Step 4: Save and Load the Model


## Source Data
This dataset was obtained from the StatLib repository using sklearn:
